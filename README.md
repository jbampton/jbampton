# Some things about me

## Feb 20th, 2026

- Just enjoyed reading the section on chess from [Around the World in 80 Games: A mathematician unlocks the secrets of the greatest games](https://www.amazon.com.au/Around-World-80-Games-mathematician-ebook/dp/B0BY85GH3Z).
Author and mathematican [Marcus du Sautoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_du_Sautoy) gave an interesting account of the history of chess and its origins over 8.5 pages with a mathematical perspective. 
- Recommenced working on [Mindful Mixed Puzzles: Over 600 puzzles](https://lakepress.com.au/products/mindful-600-puzzles-mixed-puzzles-pastel-green). This fantastic ring bound book has 8 types of puzzles and so
far I have only worked on two types of puzzles: the Word Square and the Word Chain.
- Found a small `Simply Word Fill-Ins` [Puzzler](https://www.puzzler.com.au/magazines/) brand magazine issue number 87 with 100 puzzles from 2024 which cost $6.95 AUD. Whilst I did enjoy completing two fill-ins,
  I found it was really easy to complete them since the answers were given and you just had to fill-in the grid. I definitely prefer a much harder challenge.
- Opened a [Spider-Man brand LEGO minifigure](https://www.lego.com/en-au/product/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-71050) which cost $5 AUD from [Coles Supermarket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coles_Supermarkets). There are 12 to collect and each minifigure comes in a blind pick small cardboard box. This one was the `Spider-Byte` minifigure the last packet on the shelf.

## 2026

- Currently working on some of the puzzles from the magazine "Christine's Big Crossword" Issue 392.
  This magazine has 28+ giant puzzles and cost $9.50 AUD.
  `Lovatts Crosswords and Puzzles` is a family run business that sells a number of different
  [puzzle magazines](https://lovattspuzzles.com/lovatts-crossword-puzzle-magazines/)
- I am up to puzzle 16 from [The Times Chess Winning Moves: 540 Chess Puzzles from Tournament Play](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Times-Chess-Winning-Moves-Tournament/dp/0008748888).
  Really enjoyed the first 15 puzzles and the commentary from author Byron Jacobs.
  Published in 2025 most puzzles are from modern games with the first intro puzzle being a Magnus Carslen victory.
  [The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times) is a British daily national newspaper based in London.
- I have read 50 pages of the famous book [Minute Cryptic](https://www.minutecryptic.com/) a bestseller that teaches you how to solve cryptic crossword clues.
  [Check out the Minute Cryptic YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MinuteCryptic)
- Currently reading [Checkmate! The Wonderful World of Chess](https://www.amazon.com.au/Checkmate-Wonderful-World-John-Foley/dp/1839352485) by author John Foley up to page 42.
  A glossy colorful and easy to read 112 page book aimed at beginners and children full of illustrations.
- I'm happy with the QX Chess small magnetic foldable chess board that I am now using on my work desk.
  [No. QX2677](https://www.mrtoys.com.au/games/board-games/chess-sets/magnetic-chess-47245.html) with black and white pieces and black and gray colored squares
  originally bought for $10 AUD
